# ElementsOfProgrammingLanguages
Few computer scientists will ever design a new, general-purpose language, but most will need to learn several languages over the course of a career, and many will design new domain-specific languages for restricted problem domains. Programming language design involves many subtle choices and tradeoffs among performance, convenience, and elegance. Although some of the earliest programming languages (such as FORTRAN) are still going strong, new language designs and features are still being proposed, and it seems that we are still far from fully understanding the space of possible language designs.  Elements of Programming Languages covers the essential programming structures for managing data and controlling computation, as well as abstractions that facilitate decomposing large systems into modules. The course also covers pragmatics of programming languages, including abstract syntax, interpretation and domain-specific language implementation. Elements of Programming Languages is not about learning or programming in one specific language, rather, it covers the basic elements needed to understand the next 700 programming languages, or design a new one.
